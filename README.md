# XcpMaster
The master node of XCP  (Universal Measurement and Calibration Protocol) protocol. It'a Qt refactoring version referring to the [@robotjatek XCP repo](https://github.com/robotjatek/XCP). I made some modifications to fit my project.

This repo is mainly for my [CCP (XCP on CAN) plugin](https://github.com/lotusczp/CCP-Plugin) of [Lobster](https://github.com/lotusczp/Lobster). And also XCP on Ethernet plugin.

## Todo
- Need to support timestamp in the near future.
